# YumYumDonut
## YumYumDonut : Commodore 64 Game for the BASIC 10Liner Contest
**Â©2023 Adam Whitney**

### Intro

YumYumDonut is the first video game I have ever created. I made it as an entry into the [BASIC 10Liner Contest](https://www.homeputerium.de/). It was inspired (and named) by my daughter, who loves pandas and believes that they should be able to enjoy delicious donuts too.

### Loading the Game

Drag yumyumdonut.D64 to your VICE emulator to load the game. Make sure the joystick in port 2 is enabled in the VICE input device settings and configured for a keyboard keymap that works for you.

If you have native hardware, copy the D64 image to a floppy disk or load it via a device such as an SD2IEC. Assuming your floppy or SD2IEC drive is device #8, then issue the following commands:

    LOAD "YUMYUMDONUT",8
    RUN

### Game Play

You are a panda with a hankering for a delicous donut. Upon taking your first bite, you are surprised to see the donut running away! It is so tasty, you must pursue it and take as many yummy bites as possible.

Use the joystick (in port 2) to move the panda in pursuit of the donut. Each successful bite adds one to your score of Yum!
